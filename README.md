Data repo 
==========
- Containing mostly code snippets for niche topics, and workflows to remember as well as personal projects.

- Check out the RshinyHelpers package for #rstats users that accumulates helpful shiny div elements and css helpers that 
I use only once or twice a shiny app.  Also contains misc data functions that I find intuitive but dont fit any tidy workflow.

- It is not available on CRAN. Install the package using

`if(!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('aarong1/RshinyHelpers')`

and load the functions globally

`library(Rpack)`



*Due to my own mistake the git repo is miss named from the R package.*
