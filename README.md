##Data repo 

-Containing mostly code snippets for niche topics, and workflows to remember as well as personal projects.

-Check out the RshinyHelpers package for #rstats users that accumulates helpful shiny div elements and css helpers that 
I use only once or twice a shiny app.  Also contains misc data functions that I find intuitive but dont fit any tidy workflow.

`if(!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('aarong1/RshinyHelpers')'

`library(Rpack)`

**Due to my own mistake the git repo is miss named from the R package.**
